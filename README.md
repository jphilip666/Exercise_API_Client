# Exercise API Client

This is a basic HTML/Javascript client side webpage used to access the API and display it to the user.
One of this API call is done synchronously and the other asynchronously as requested. 
You will need a Token to call these APIâ€™s. There is a create token feature on the top right where you can enter your credentials to receive a new token. You will need to enter this token in the Token field before calling the API's.

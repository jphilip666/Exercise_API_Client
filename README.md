## Exercise API Client

https://github.com/jphilip666/Exercise_API_Client

This is a basic HTML/Javascript client side webpage used to access the API and display it to the user.
One of this API call is done synchronously and the other asynchronously as requested. 
You will need a Token to call these API’s. There is a create token feature on the top right where you can enter your credentials to receive a new token. You will need to enter this token in the Token field before calling the API's.

## Installation instruction

- Download this project from the repository and CD into the root directory.
- Run the following command to start the Vite development server locally
    - npm run dev
    - This should start a local server usually something like  http://localhost:5173

# Postman

To test the API I created some postman requests to make it easier to test it in postman. You can use the link below and then import it in your Postman. You will need the CRUD application running to test it. We will be using http://127.0.0.1:8000 to test the API’s.
